# Big O

[TOC]

## Introduction to Big O

1. Importance of Big O:
  * Big O is a core topic in data structures and algorithms.
  * It’s frequently asked about in coding interviews.

2. What is Big O?:
  * A mathematical way to compare code based on performance (not readability or conciseness).
  * Focuses on how efficiently code runs in terms of operations, not actual execution time.

3. Time Complexity:
  * Measures how the number of operations grows as input size increases.
  * Not based on actual run time since hardware speed can vary.
  * Example: Code that takes 15 seconds vs. code that takes 60 seconds shows a performance difference in operations.

4. Space Complexity:
  * Measures how much memory a program uses.
  * Important in cases where memory usage matters more than speed.

5. Trade-offs and Use Cases:
  * Sometimes faster code uses more memory and vice versa.
  * Understanding when to prioritize time vs. space complexity is key, especially in interviews.

6. Course Focus:
  * Primarily on time complexity, with some mention of space complexity where relevant.

## Big O, Omega, and Theta Notation

1. Three Key Notations in algorithm complexity:
  * Ω (Omega) → Best case scenario.
  * Θ (Theta) → Average case scenario.
  * O (Big O / Omicron) → Worst case scenario.

2. Example with an Array:
  * Searching for a value in an array:
    * Best case (Ω): The target is the first element (e.g., number 1).
    * Worst case (O): The target is the last element (e.g., number 7).
    * Average case (Θ): The target is somewhere in the middle (e.g., number 4).

3. Common Misuse in Language:
  * People often say “average Big O” or “best-case Big O”, but:
    * Technically, Big O always refers to the worst-case performance.
    * Use Theta (Θ) for average case, and Omega (Ω) for best case.

## Understanding Big O of N (O(n))

1. Introduction to O(n):
  * O(n) is not the fastest or slowest, but it’s the easiest to understand, so it’s introduced first.

2. Example Function – printItems(n):
  * A simple function with a for loop that runs n times.
  * Each iteration prints the loop index.
  * If you pass 10, it prints 10 items (0 to 9).

3. Why It’s O(n):
  * The number of operations grows linearly with the input size n.
  * This makes it a classic case of linear time complexity.

4. Visual Representation:
  * On a graph:
    * X-axis: Input size (n)
    * Y-axis: Number of operations
  * O(n) plots as a straight line, meaning the operations grow proportionally with input.

## Big O Simplification Rule – Drop Constants

1. Rule Introduced:
  * The first rule of simplifying Big O expressions is “drop constants”.

2. Example Function:
  * A function with two separate for loops, each running n times.
  * Total operations: n + n = 2n.

3. Simplified Big O:
  * Instead of writing O(2n), we simplify it to O(n).
  * This applies even if the coefficient is larger, like 100n—it’s still simplified to O(n).

4. Why Drop Constants?:
  * Big O measures growth rate categories, not exact performance.
  * Linear growth (like 2n or 100n) behaves fundamentally different from exponential growth as n increases.
  * The simplification helps focus on the type of growth, not the precise number of operations.

5. Key Takeaway:
  * No matter how many times a linear operation is repeated, it’s still linear—so constants are dropped in Big O notation.

## Understanding O(n²) – Quadratic Time Complexity

1. Introduction to O(n²):
  * Arises when you have nested loops, where one loop runs inside another.

2. Example Function:
  * A function with a for loop nested inside another (both run n times).
  * When run with n = 10, it prints 100 lines—demonstrating n × n = n² operations.

3. Big O Classification:
  * This is O(n²) because the number of operations grows quadratically with the input size n.

4. Graph Comparison:
  * O(n²) grows much faster than O(n).
  * It’s significantly less efficient, especially as n increases.

5. Efficiency Implication:
  * When comparing two solutions—one with O(n) and one with O(n²)—O(n) is always the better choice if both solve the problem correctly.

6. Course Note:
  * O(n²) is the least efficient Big O notation covered in this course.

## Big O Simplification – Drop Non-Dominant Terms

1. Simplification Rule Introduced:
  * The second rule of Big O simplification is “drop non-dominant terms.”

2. Example Function:
  * Combines:
    * Nested for loops (O(n²))
    * Followed by a single for loop (O(n))
  * When run with n = 10, it prints:
    * 100 lines from the nested loops (0,0 to 9,9)
    * 10 lines from the single loop (0 to 9)

3. Total Complexity:
  * Mathematically: O(n² + n)
  * O(n²) is the dominant term; O(n) becomes insignificant as n increases.

4. Why Drop Non-Dominant Terms:
  * For large input sizes, the lower-order term (O(n)) contributes negligibly to total growth.
  * Simplified Big O: O(n²)

5. Key Takeaway:
  * When multiple complexities are added, only the term with the highest growth rate is kept.

## Understanding O(1) – Constant Time Complexity

1. Introduction to O(1):
  * Represents operations where the execution time does not grow with the input size n.

2. Example Function – addItems(n):
  * Performs a simple addition: n + n.
  * Whether n is 1 or 1,000,000, it still performs one operation.

3. Simplification Reminder:
  * Even if you add n + n + n (which is technically two operations), it’s still considered O(1) because constants are dropped in Big O notation.

4. Graph Representation:
  * Appears as a flat horizontal line on a graph.
  * Indicates no growth in operations as input increases.

5. Efficiency Insight:
  * Most efficient Big O class.
  * Ideal whenever a task can be completed in constant time, regardless of input size.

## Understanding O(log n) – Logarithmic Time Complexity

1. What Is O(log n)?
  * Time complexity where the number of operations grows slowly as input size increases.
  * Commonly seen in binary search and divide-and-conquer algorithms.

2. Binary Search Demonstration:
  * Given a sorted list of 8 elements, the algorithm:
    * Cuts the list in half repeatedly to find a target number.
    * Example: Finding the number 1 took 3 steps.
    * Since 2^3 = 8, this is log base 2 of 8 = 3.

3. General Rule:
  * O(log n) = The number of times you must halve a list to reduce it to a single item.
  * Example: For a list of 1 billion items, binary search would take only 31 steps.

4. Graph Representation:
  * Appears as a slowly rising curve—much flatter than O(n) and O(n²), but slightly above O(1).
  * Indicates high efficiency, especially for large datasets.

5. Bonus Concept – O(n log n):
  * A time complexity used in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.
  * O(n log n) is the best general-case efficiency possible for comparison-based sorting.

6. Key Takeaways:
  * O(log n) is highly efficient and important in real-world algorithms.
  * Along with O(1), O(n), and O(n²), it’s one of the four most common Big O types seen in the course.

## Big O with Multiple Input Terms (Different Variables)

1. Single vs. Multiple Inputs:
  * Previously, a function with two for loops running n times was simplified from O(2n) to O(n).
  * That worked because both loops depended on the same input n.

2. New Example with Two Inputs (a and b):
  * A function now has:
    * One loop that runs a times → O(a)
    * Another loop that runs b times → O(b)

3. Common Mistake:
  * Incorrectly assuming both inputs are the same (a = n, b = n) and simplifying to O(n).
  * This is not valid when a and b represent different input sizes.

4. Correct Simplification:
  * When the loops are sequential: O(a + b)
  * When one loop is nested inside the other: O(a × b)

5. Key Takeaway:
  * When a function receives multiple independent inputs, their complexities must be treated separately.
  * You cannot combine or simplify them as if they’re the same variable.

## Big O of Vectors (and Arrays)

1. General Concept:
  * Most operations on vectors also apply to arrays.
  * The variable n refers to the number of items in the vector or array.

2. Efficient (O(1)) Operations:
  * Adding to the end (push_back)
  * Removing from the end (pop_back)
  * Accessing by index (e.g., vec[3])
  * ✅ These are all O(1) because no reindexing or shifting is required.

3. Inefficient (O(n)) Operations:
  * Inserting or removing from the beginning (insert or erase at begin()):
    * Requires shifting all subsequent elements to update their positions.
  * Inserting or removing in the middle:
    * Also requires shifting elements, so it’s still O(n).
    * Even though it may seem like “half of n”, constants like ½ are dropped in Big O.
  * Searching by value:
    * Requires checking each element → O(n) (linear search).

4. Key Takeaways:
  * ✅ O(1): push_back, pop_back, access by index.
  * ❌ O(n): insert, erase (except at the end), search by value.
  * Efficiency depends on where the operation occurs in the vector.

## Big O Wrap-Up

### 📈 Comparing Growth Rates (n = 100 and 1000):  
* When n = 100:
  * O(1) → 1 operation
  * O(log n) → ~7 operations
  * O(n) → 100 operations
  * O(n²) → 10,000 operations
* When n = 1000:
  * O(1) → 1 operation (unchanged)
  * O(log n) → ~10 operations
  * O(n) → 1000 operations
  * O(n²) → 1,000,000 operations

> 🔸 Key Insight: As n grows, O(n²) becomes dramatically less efficient than the others.
